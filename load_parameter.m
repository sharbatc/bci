fs = 2048; % sampling rate

%% MODIFY/ADD BELOW
nBuffCh = 64; % # of buffer channel. YOU CAN MODIFY IF YOU KNOW HOW TO CHANGE IN ndf_online_tid.m (You need to select channels properly!!)
file = './??.mat'; % IF YOU HAVE A FILE TO READ %classifier
buffLength = 1.0; % buffer length (1.0 = 1-second) for both eeg and trigger. THIS IS THE OBSERVATION WINDOW FOR GENERATING A FEATURE VECTOR

%% ADD ANYTHING YOU WILL NEED TO INITIALIZES
%	e.g. spectral filter, feature extraction model, classification model.

%	THE MODEL IS PREFERRED TO INITIALIZE AS A STRUCT VARIABLE NAMED AS user. Details please refer to ndf_online_tid.m
user = struct();
user.pSpec.freqBand %ask what to change
user.chSel
user.classifier = load(file); %loading of the classifier
user.Filter = filterChannels
    % Prepare your spectral filter, if you need. 
	%	The filter must be able to support step function OR you change the corresponding code in ndf_online_tid.m
	%	Be aware of MATLAB VERSION. It is R2016b.
